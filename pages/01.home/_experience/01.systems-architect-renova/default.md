In December I requested to be given the latitude to step down as VP to experiment in running the department through a structure inspired by [Democracy At Work](https://www.democracyatwork.info/) and [Holocracy®](https://www.holacracy.org/) that encouraged automous decision making within each workers domain and voting when domains crossed. 
* I re-wrote my job description so that I could work on development projects and spend less time managing people and resources. 
* During this time I was able to orchestrate a large record restructuring, data migration, and scripting automations within the company Netsuite instance. 
* Wrote 3500+ lines of code & 850+ lines of documentation & SOP's.
