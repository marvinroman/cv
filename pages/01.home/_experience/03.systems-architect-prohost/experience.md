Brought in for my expertise developing in Magento and to help optimize server systems to the platform and help with customer questions specific to the platform. I quickly learned how to maintain the server hosting ecosystem and began improving clients hosting environments both in security & performance.
##### Accomplishments
* Built out clustered solutions for larger companies that needed scalable solutions to handle high traffic loads. Included start-up & shut-down scripts that would add backend servers to front-end load balancers. (Before the popularity of Kubernetes).
* Optimized client content delivery using NGINX Pagespeed including static file sharding to CDNs, image optimization, JS & CSS minification.
* Created Varnish configurations to accelerate site and fetch only dynamic blocks.
* Used NGINX request throttling and Fail2Ban to help prevent DDOS.
* Created NGINX bot caching to make sure bots got cached versions of the site to prevent bots from overloading smaller sites due to crawling.
* Created custom control panel to manage our very custom NGINX, PHP & MySQL setup. Was run off BerkeleyDB to make sure no running database was necessary to have a running control panel.
* Developed hot database backup system with encrypted remote backups.
* Created migration scripts to automate migrations.
* Created Puppet server to manage the growing number of VPS's & dedicated servers and give us the ability to simplify deployments and upgrades.
