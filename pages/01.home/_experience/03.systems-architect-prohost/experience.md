Brought in for my expertise developing in Magento and to help optimize server systems to the platform and help with customer questions specific to the platform. I quickly learned how to maintain the server hosting ecosystem and began improving clients hosting environments both in security & performance.
* NGINX Pagespeed to improved browser performance including static file sharding to CDNs, image optimization, JS & CSS minification.
* Created Varnish configurations to accelerate site and fetch only dynamic blocks.
* Used NGINX request throttling and Fail2Ban to help prevent DDOS.
* Created NGINX bot caching to make sure bots got cached versions of the site to prevent bots from overloading smaller sites due to crawling.
* Created custom control panel.
* Developed hot database backup system with encrypted remote backups.
* Created migration scripts to automate migrations.
